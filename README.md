# Inventory App

### requirements and goals

**Goal**

Inventory Appâ€™s primary goal is to track items within a warehouse using handheld devices. Through this application, warehouse workers will be able to easily keep up with what is in stock and what needs to be replenished. 
It also gives the workers the flexibility of not being stuck to a desk in front of a desktop computer, or paper and pen as they can see updates in real-time in the palm of their hand.

**Needs**

-	Database with two tables
-	Inventory Items
-	User username and password
-	Login / Signup screen
-	Grid Screen that displays all items in the inventory
-	Mechanism that allows the user can add and remove items from inventory
-	Mechanism that allows the user to increase or decrease the number of an item
-	Notifications for when the amount of any item has been reduced to 0

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?
There are main 4 screens: login, inventory overview, item view, and sms notification options. These screens cover the overall needs of the users. In the item view, users are able to update the quantity of the item as they need to.
They are also able to add and delete new and/or old items from their inventory.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app?

I pretty much lived on the Android Developers recources website. There is so much information on there to help with most of what you need. Of course me being me, I run into problems regardless. I took it one screen at a time at first because
that felt less overwhelming but quickly learned that all of the screens code blends in with each other.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional?

I constantly used the debugger to make sure everything was working correctly. I used the emulator as well but once I got to the end of writing the code, the emulator stopped working even though the code ran without bugs.
In the future I will spend more time learning how to fix this problem so it doesn't happen again.

### From initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Designing the actual screens before coding it. There are obviously rules and guidelines when designing an Android app, but starting from scratch was daunting as I have never worked in Android Studio before this.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

As far as design, I think my log in screen is pretty great. The rest I feel I can improve on. I also think my App Launch Plan was quite good.
